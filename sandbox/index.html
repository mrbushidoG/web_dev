    <h1>Basic document flow</h1>

    <p class="make-inline">
      I am a basic block level element. My adjacent block level elements sit on
      new lines below me.
    </p>

    <p class="make-inline shift-right">
      By default we span 100% of the width of our parent element, and we are as
      tall as our child content. Our total width and height is our content +
      padding + border width/height.
    </p>

    <p>
      We are separated by our margins. Because of margin collapsing, we are
      separated by the size of one of our margins, not both.
    </p>

    <p>
      Inline elements <span class="inline-block">like this one</span> and <span class="new-line">this one</span> sit
      on the same line along with adjacent text nodes, if there is space on the
      same line. Overflowing inline elements will
      <span
        >wrap onto a new line if possible (like this one containing text)</span
      >, or just go on to a new line if not, much like this image will do:
      <img
        src="https://mdn.github.io/shared-assets/images/examples/long.jpg"
        alt="snippet of cloth"
      />
